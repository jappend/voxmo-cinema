# VOXMO

VOXMO is a fullstack project created as a challenge, which was inspired by IMDB, the concept of the application is an online movie database, where everyone can create an account, rate movies, make comments and more. The frontend of the application was made by me, and the API used is [Cinema Grader](https://github.com/VinofSteel/cinema_grader/), made by my friend and great programmer, [VinOfSteel](https://github.com/VinofSteel).
